# Brainfuck
I wrote a brainfuck interpreter and some scripts

## How to use it
It is really simple to get started, you can run `python brainfuck.py delen.bf.txt` to run my brainfuck script for dividing by 10
If you want to run your own scripts, run the command `python brainfuck.py path/to/file.bf`. However, I recommend you just add them to the same folder, that will make it easier to run them.
